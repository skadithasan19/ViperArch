# ViperArch
VIPER is an application of Clean Architecture to iOS apps. The word VIPER name Stand's for View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, and Routing. Clean Architecture divides an appâ€™s logical structure into distinct layers of responsibility. This makes it easier to isolate dependencies (e.g. your database) and to test the interactions at the boundaries between layers
